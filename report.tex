\section{Introduction}

The following report is aimed at undergraduate 
students familiar with lagrangian mechanics, hamiltonian mechanics,
quantum mechanics, and topology. For a guide to the expected prerequisite knowledge see \cite{mathphys1, mathphys2, topnotes}.

[The aim of this report is to offer a gentle 
introduction to quantum field theory, and offer 
insight into one example of where topology shows up 
in theoretical physics.] - CHANGE THIS

Explain structure of report here. 

\section{Quantum States}

One should be familiar with the notion of a quantum wavefunction, such as 
$\psi(x)$, which describes the position of a particle. 
However, in quantum field theory we deal with a more 
abstract concept called a quantum state.

\begin{defn}
Define Hilbert space
\end{defn}

\begin{notation}
We use the Bra-Ket notation for vectors in Hilbert space. A 
vector is written as $| \psi \rangle$ and a covector is 
written as $\langle \phi |$. We define \[ \langle \phi | \psi \rangle := \langle \phi | (| \psi \rangle) \]
Given a vector 
$| \psi \rangle$ the corresponding hermition transpose of 
this vector is $\langle \psi |$, meaning 
$|\psi|^2 = \langle \psi | \psi \rangle$.
\end{notation}

A quantum state is a mathematical entity that embodies all 
the known information of some given quantum system. There 
are two types of quantum states, pure and mixed. We will 
only explain pure quantum states in this section.

A (pure) quantum state is an abstract vector in a complex 
Hilbert space, denoted by $| \psi \rangle $. This Hilbert 
space is called our state space and often has infinite 
dimensions.

Observables of our quantum system correspond to Hermition 
operators on our state space. The eigenvalues of such an 
operator are real and correspond to possible observed 
values. It can be shown that the eigenstates of any 
Hermition operator form a basis for our state space. This 
allows us to relate quantum states to the more familiar 
notion of a quantum wavefunction.

Let $\langle \psi |$ be a quantum state and $\hat{X}$ be the position operator with eigenstates $|x \rangle$. Then $\psi (x) = \langle x | \psi \rangle$. WHY???


\section{The Heisenburg Picture of Quantum Mechanics}

One is usually introduced to quantum mechanics in the 
Schrödinger picture, however, in quantum field theory, 
it is more natural to consider the Heisenburg picture.

In the Schrödinger picture, the quantum states vary with 
time. For example, our quantum state may be represented 
by a wave function $\psi(x,t)$, which evolves in time. 
Conversely,
the operators that act on our state space, such as 
momentum, position, etc, are usually fixed with respect to time. 
The only exception to this is that the Hamiltonian may include 
a potential energy term that varies with time. 

Consider a time dependent quantum state 
$| \psi(t) \rangle$. This state evolves in time 
according the  Schrodinger equation. One can 
represent this via a unitary time-evolution operator 
$U(t,t_0)$ 
as follows;
\[ | \psi(t) \rangle = U(t,t_0) | \psi(t_0) \rangle .\]

In the Schrödinger 
picture, the expectation of a potentially time-dependent hermition operator, $A(t)$, in the 
state $| \psi(t) \rangle$,  can be written as 
\[\langle \hat{A}(t) \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | \hat{A}(t) | \psi(t) \rangle.\]
Choosing some reference time $t_0$ we can rewrite this as
\[\langle \psi(t_0) | \hat{U}\textsuperscript{\textdagger}(t,t_0) \hat{A}  (t) \hat{U}(t,t_0) | \psi(t_0) \rangle.\]
If we define 
\[\hat{A_H}(t) = \hat{U}\textsuperscript{\textdagger}(t,t_0) \hat{A}  (t) \hat{U}(t,t_0) \]
then we have 
\[\langle \hat{A}(t) \rangle = \langle \psi(t_0) | \hat{A_H}(t) | \psi(t_0) \rangle.\]

So we notice that we could have obtained this same 
expectation by considering a constant quantum state 
$| \psi(t_0) \rangle$ and a new operator that evolves with 
time. This is the idea behind the Heisenberg picture of 
quantum mechanics. One interprets the quantum states as 
being fixed in time, and it is the operators that evolve 
in time. 

In the Schrödinger picture, the Schrödinger equation 
governs the time evolution of quantum states. Hence, a 
natural question is, in the Heisenberg picture, how do the 
operators evolve in time?

One can derive the following equation
\[ \frac{d}{dt} \hat{A}_H(t) = \frac{1}{i \hbar} [\hat{A}_H(t), \hat{H}_H(t)] + \left[\frac{d}{dt} \hat{A}_S(t) \right]_H \]
where the subscripts $S$ and $H$ denote whether we are considering the element in the Schrodinger or Heisenberg picture respectively. 

\section{Classical field theory \& Noether's theorem}

In classical mechanics we consider a countable set of particles
each with finitely many degrees of freedom
and generalised coordinates $q_i(t)$. These generalised coordinates ${\{ q_i(t) \}}_i$ specify
the system's configuration (position in configuration space) and together with the 
generalised conjugate momenta
${\left\{p_i(t) \coloneq \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \right\}}_i $ 
define the system's position in phase space.

In classical field theory we generalise this notion of configuration space to a
continuum with infinite degrees of freedom. The scalar field $\phi(t)$ can be seen as
the generalised coordinates of a continuum 
$\left( q_i(t) \xrightarrow{i \rightarrow \vec{x}} \phi(\vec{x}, t) \right)$ and for a system
of continua the set of scalar fields ${\{ \phi_k(\vec{x}, t) \}}_k$
specifies the system's configuration.


Subsequently, we generalise the classical Lagrangian $L(q_i(t), \dot{q}_i(t), t)$ via
\begin{equation}
  L(t) = \int{d^{3}\vec{x} \mathcal{L}(\phi_k(\vec{x}, t),\partial_{\mu}\phi_k(\vec{x}, t), t)}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian density. With respect to some path
in configuration space, $\vec{\Phi}(\vec{x}, t)$, the classical action becomes 
\begin{equation}
  S\left[\vec{\Phi}(\vec{x}, t) \right] = \int{dt L} 
  = \int{d^4x \mathcal{L}(\phi_k(\vec{x}, t),\partial_{\mu}\phi_k(\vec{x}, t), t)}
\end{equation}
Using Hamilton's principle $\left( \frac{\delta S}{\delta \vec{\Phi} } = 0 \right)$ we obtain
the Euler-Lagrange equations 
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi_k}
  = \partial_\mu \left[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu{\phi_k}) } \right]
\end{equation}
In classical mechanics we define the hamiltonian, $H(p_i(t), q_i(t), t)$, via the
Legendre transform (IS THIS ACTUALLY THE DEFINITION OF H? ASK INAKI)
\begin{equation}
  H = \sum_{i}{p_i(t)\dot{q}_i(t) - L}
\end{equation}
to generalise this to field theory we introduce the momentum field conjugate to 
$\phi_k(\vec{x}, t)$
\begin{equation}
  \pi_k(\vec{x}, t) \coloneq \frac{\partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial \dot{\phi}_k}
\end{equation}


We define the momentum fields conjugate to 

***NOT SURE IF THIS WILL BE NEEDED

The fields in the Lagrangian density are relativistic, 
meaning under Lorentz tranformations
\[ x'^{\mu} = \Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu} x^{\nu} \]
they transform as 
\[ \phi_i'(x') = R_l^j \phi_i(x) \]

**what is i? Does it matter?

We use the Minkowski metric 
\[ \eta_{\mu \nu} = diag(-1,1,1,1) \]
in these notes.

\section{Path Integral \& Generating Functional}
Given a particle position $x$ at time $t$ the probability amplitude of
a measurement at time $t'$ observing a position $x'$ is

\begin{align*}
  \begin{split}
  M(x', t'; x, t) &= \prescript{}{H}{\braket{x',t'|x, t}_{H}}
  \end{split} \\
  \begin{split}
  &= \braket{x'|\exp{\left[\frac{-i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(t-t')\right]}|x}
  \end{split}
\end{align*}\label{eq:1}
now we note that if the states are normalised
\begin{equation}
  \int{dy |y,t\rangle{} \langle{y,t|} } = \mathbb{I}
\end{equation}
we can write 
  \begin{equation}
    M(x', t'; x, t) = \sum_{n}{\psi_{n}(x')\psi_{n}^*(x)\exp{\left[\frac{-i}{\hbar}\hat{H}(t-t')\right]}}
  \end{equation}
which acts as our propagator
\begin{equation}
 \psi(x', t') = \int{dx \ M(x', t'; x, t) \psi(x, t)}
 \partial^{x}_{\mu}
\end{equation}
